# SnakeGame
I've created this project as a part of my learning path of Python language. I believe that creating games is the easiest why to undestand the basics of structure and code of particular programming language. This is a popular game called SnakeGame where a worm/snake eats the apples, grows and tries not to eat itself or hit the border (in one of the levels).

There are a few versions of SnakeGame that I created over a time (different commits):
  
  Version 1.0 The game mechanism uses solely functions (no classes)
    
  Version 2.0 The code restructured into classes
  
  Version 3.0 Upgraded the graphics
